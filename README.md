# LyaChallenge

This repository will be used to coordinate different Lyman-alpha Data challenges.

We will start by a data challenge on P1D emulators, with the idea of extending it to P3D and bispectra emulators. Other future ideas include data challenges related to estimator of power spectra / correlation functions and BAO fitters.
